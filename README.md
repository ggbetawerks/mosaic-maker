# GG BetaWerks Mosaic Maker

This will be a brick-based mosaic maker for use with Lego bricks or compatible bricks, but is a work in progress at least for the foreseeable future.

The plan is to make a web-based application that is as simple to use as the Mac / Apple only [Photobricks](http://www.photobricksapp.com/) but works everywhere. Some of the features that I want to be able to ultimately add are inspired by [PicToBrick](http://www.pictobrick.de/en/pictobrick.shtml) as well.
